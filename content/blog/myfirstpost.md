From 11th to 13th April 2025, I attended my first ever Population Association of America (PAA) conference in Washington. It was nice to meet and engage senior demographers, whose work I have only been reading this far, and meet future collaborators. I conversed with established researchers, post docs and current students working on health, mortality, ageing, fertility, population dynamics, and expanding the range of methods applicable to demographic inquiry. I saw posters that covered topics that have been useful in my first-year paper and which I hope to be key as I develop my PhD proposal. For example, work from Strzelecki infirmed me how others are approaching the study of subjective mortality expectations among older adults, and work from China by â€¦and colleagues tackled issues around modelling transitions in demography a particular interest of mine.
